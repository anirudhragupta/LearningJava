# Learning Java

Programming using Java

## Introduction

Java is statically typed case-sensitive language.

### Definitions

-------------------
You run your Java programs with JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and JRE (java Runtime Edition).

- JDK: Java Development Kit

We are using JDK 17 (Java version 17): [Download Link](https://java.sun.com)

To verify installation, run:

```powershell
java --version 
javac --version
```

- JShell: Read-Eval-Print-Loop interactive program (REPL)

Just type `jshell` in terminal. Use `{` to add code in multiple lines followed by enter. Use `/help` or `/exit` to exit the JShell.

`/list` will show all the commands you've executed in the JShell session
